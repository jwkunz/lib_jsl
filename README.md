# lib_jsl
"Jake's Scientific Library" is a library of scientific computing routines written in Rust.  Some of the content and organization is inspired by the famous book "Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing", but there are many other routines taken from other sources encountered during the author's career.  
Although some of routines are translations of routines and algorithms originally authored in (fast,optimized,terse) C/C++, in all cases the author has attempted to use good style and adhere to the principles of idiomatic Rust.

## Dependencies

The library has minimalistic dependencies, but does use the quasi-standard packages: num and ndarray.  

## Sections
The library is organized by high level sections:
*  Interpolation
